## Quick Review 
- History
    - Centralized - decentralized - centralized
- Why Cloud
    - Cost, elasticity, resilience, agility
- Types of Cloud
    - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
    - Public, private, hybrid
- Providers (hyperscalers)
    - AWS, Azure, GWS
## New Stuff
- Textbook Chapters 4&5
- Provider resources
- Data Centers, Hardware, Networks, Internet
- Virtualization
    - Structure
    - Hardware-vs-software
## Data Centers (IaaS)
- Cabinets - racks - servers
- Physical networking to Internet (switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers)
- Racks
- Servers (processors, RAM, HDD) - real & virtual
- Climate Controls - 70 degrees
- Stable power ~1% variation
- Secure access
- On site tech support
- Prep rooms, conference rooms, break rooms. showers, sleeping areas

## Bring your own Data Center (BYODC)
- Colocation
- Why? = total control of equipment
- Provider rents space and supplies internet
- Servers
- NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- Swithces
- Firewall
- Auxiliary power
- Patch cables
- Zip ties/Velcro for cable management 

## Own vs Rent
- BYODC
    - Own hardware
    - Known HW/SW costs
    - Fixed usage costs
- Provider
    - No capital cost
    - Variable hardware usage cost
    - Variable usage cost

## Virtualization
- VM = Virtual Machine
### Software Emulation = dissimilar OSs
- Compiler
- Boot Camp MAC - either/or
- Parallels MAC - simultaneously
- VirtualBox
- High overhead, slower

### Para-Virtualization
- Dual Boot - 2 OSs simultaneously
- Needs hypervisor to keep OS isolated
- I/O Controlled by hypervisor
- Requires OS modification
- High overhead
- Limited by physical resources 

### Total Virtualization
- Standard configuration for computers
- Host + guest
- Hypervisors
- Dynamic Resources
- OS feature or 3rd party
- Limited by physical resources 
- Virtual devices

### Why?
- Dedicated servers and apps - DB, Web, Intranet
- Internal SaaS
- Compliance, regulations
- Low cost of deployment
- Dynamic Resources - elasticity
- Faster
