# Introduction to Cloud Computing CS399

## **Course Goals**
- Explore the world of Cloud Computing (CC)
- Learn the components and technologies of CC
- Evaluate CC providers
- Hardware, software, writing code, security, and performance
- Research and report on CC environments
- Design, build, deploy, and maintain a CC project
- Emphasis on hands on experience 

### **Consider**
- **Enterprise** - business, entity, or environment spread out over multiple locations, i.e. a University, each building is a separate location, interconnected with fiber/vpn, integrated through wireless networks
- 94% of enterprises use cloud services
- 67% of enterprise infrastructure is now cloud-based
- 92% of businesses have a multi-cloud strategy in place or in the works
- The global cloud computing industry has a market size of $480.04 Bn, as of 2022
- The need for cloud architects, engineers, programmers, security experts grows 300% every year

### **Topics**
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Public, private, and hybrid clouds
- healthcare, E-commerce, education, engineering, government
- Virtualization and serverless computing
- Docker, Containers, Kubernetes
- Dev Ops and open source
- Cloud security

### **Project**
- Project description in folder in Canvas
- Form teams of 2-3 students
- Monday July 3 - report on team formation
- Proposal: identify a real-world something that CC can address
    - Problem, event, software, system, infrastructure, etc
    - Must be original and cannot use another's work
    - Cannot be illegal
    - Simple to be completed in 6 weeks
- Weekly reports

### **Cloud Computing**
- What is Cloud Computing?
    - Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services–including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence–over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. (Microsoft)
- Why Cloud Computing? 
    - Cost
    - Agility
    - Resilience
    - Security
    - Intelligence

    **Evolution of Cloud Computing**
    - Prehistoric days
        - 1960s Magnetic tape and IBM cards
    - Olden days
        - 1970-1980s: Apple, Microsoft, centralized computing
    - Middle Ages
        - 1980-1993: Personal computers + Internet is born
    - Industrial revolution
        - 1993-2014: Decentralized Computing
    - Modern times
        - 2015-now: Internet & IoT driving centralized computing 
        - Elastic Computing

## **Types**
### **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Allows organizations to purchase resources like networking and storage on-demand instead of having to buy costly hardware. IaaS is highly scalable and offers businesses more flexibility than on-premise solutions
### **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- The platform that can be accessed through the internet provides developers with a framework and tools to build apps and software that are tailored to the organization's inidividual needs
### **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- These entire cloud application services are the most common form of cloud-computing. They are ready-to-use and often run directly through the client's web browser, meaning there is no need for installations or downloads like it with on-prem solutions
### **Examples**
- Infrastructure as a service
    - AWS Amazon Web Services
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Google Compute Engine
- Platform as a Service
    - Google App Engine
    - Windows Azure
    - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Software as a Service
    - Google Apps
    - Microsoft 365
#### **Types cont...** 
- Public Cloud
    - Public clouds are cloud environments typicall created from IT infrastructure not owned by the end user
- Private Cloud
    - Private clouds are cloud environments solely dedicated to a single entity or group, where the environment usually runs behind that user or groups' firewall
- Hybrid Cloud
    - A hybrid cloud is a single IT environment created from multiple environments connected through local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and/or APIs
