## Quick Review
- Provider Resources
- Data Centers, Hardware, Networks, Internet
- Virtualization
    - Structure
    - Software = terminal emulation (thin clients)
    - Hardware = hypervisors to manage resources
    - VMs = digital object (.vhd, .vdi, .vmx)

## Virtualization
- Why VMs?
    - Persistence
    - Dedicated
    - Stable - multiple apps
- Why VLANs?
    - Segment multiple subnets
    - Isolation and security
- Why Virtual Storage?
    - Block Storage
    - Byte/Object storage

## Containers, Why?
- Easier than Linux namespaces
- Dynamic - similar to processes, only when needed
- Exclusive of OS
- Self contained app
- Less overhead
- Stored as image = digital object
- Easily replicated
- Requires hypervisor = Docker

## Docker
- Open Source
- Container hypervisor
- Cannot host a VM
- Dockerd - container management engine
    - build self contained images
    - configure Docker to execute images
    - Can spin up containers on multiple servers

## Automation
- Why?
    - Repetition
    - Patching and updating
    - Dynamic environments
    - Monitoring and logging
    - DR/BC - Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity
    - Security - zero trust
    - Human error

## Orchestration
- Runs as a Service
- Containers, networks, storage
- Rapid deployment and creation
- Short TTL
- Replication
- Dynamic
    - Load Balancing
    - Fault tolerant - resilient and recoverable

## Kubernetes
### Developed by Google
- Service Naming and Discovery
- Load Balancing
- Storage Orchestration
- Optimized container placement
- Automated recovery
- Management of configurations and secrets
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
### Limitations
- Only manages containers
- Cannot run VMs
- Requires hypervisor to spin up containers - Docker
- Is application neutral - may need customization
- Doesn't manage source code
- Doesn't interface with event handling
- Doesn't perform monitoring or logging

## Project
### Project planning - Before touching a cloud resource
#### Create a path to completion
- Critical path or timeline
- include depdendencies &/or prerequisites
#### Determine resources
- Time = most important resource
- Careful about underestimating needs or time
- VM or Container?, storage, DB, network
#### Define and set milestones
- Targeted and achievable
- Realistic and timely

## Project conet.
### Project planning
#### Tasks
- Define and delegate
- Does the team member have the skills to complete the task?
- Each team member responsible for their share
- Set time limits on tasks - if unachievable - Adapt
#### Test Test Test
- Test each completed task or subcomponent 
- Use SW development methodologies (waterfall, etc)
#### Project plans and status report due Sunday 7/16
